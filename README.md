# UBLOCKorigin_No-I-dont-want-premium
An uBlock Origin blocklist that eliminates pop-ups asking you to subscribe to a service or to buy the premium version. For people who are Tired of intrusive pop-ups asking for money.
Ideally, all filters in this blocklist should still allow you to purchase the services in question if you so choose. The aim is not to remove references to subscriptions or paid features entirely, but rather exclusively the unsollicited advertising of said features, for a better F2U experience. So this blocklist shouldn't remove non-intrusive elements. For example, this blocklist removes all mentions of Nitro in the Discord homepage, but still allows users to purchase the service through the settings if they so choose.

! CURRENTLY A WIP (public only to test it with the Ublock import feature)
