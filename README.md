This is public only to test it with the Ublock import feature.


# uBlockOrigin filter list: No, I don't want premium!
An uBlock Origin blocklist that eliminates pop-ups asking you to subscribe to a service or to buy the premium version. For people who are Tired of intrusive pop-ups asking for money.\
Ideally, all filters in this blocklist should still allow you to purchase the services in question if you so choose. The aim is not to remove references to subscriptions or paid features entirely, but rather exclusively the unsollicited advertising of said features, for a better F2U experience. Will mostly remove pop-ups and mentions of paid features from homepages, navbars, and hamburger menus used for navigation.\

If for some godforsaken reason you want to use this list in its current state, copy this link to the raw file and import it in UblockO:\
